- Hello everyone and welcome on my GitHub personal page! (And congratulation on finding it!)
- I am also know as Naoki Takei.
- I'm a tech enthuasiast, studying topics ranging from Solid State physics, Microelectronics to programming.
- My main interest is in Electronics for Computer Architures & CPU/GPU Architectures.
- I also write some courses on Electrical Engineering topics (ie Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Semiconductor Physics and Computer Architecture).
