- Hello everyone and welcome on my GitHub personal page! (And congratulation on finding it!)
- I am also know as Naoki Takei.
- I'm a tech enthuasiast, ranging from Solid State physics, Microelectronics to programming.
- My main interest is in Electronics for Computer Architures & CPU/GPU Architectures.
- I also write some courses on Electrical Engineering topics (ie Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Semiconductor Physics and Computer Architecture).

- My current research topics are:
   * **CPU/FPGA**.
   * **HW/SW co-design**.
   * **SoCs and NoCs**.
   * **VLSI**.
   * HLS.
   * LLMs.
