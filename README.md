- Hello everyone and welcome on my GitHub personal page! (And congratulation on finding it!)
- I am also know as Naoki Takei.
- I'm a tech enthuasiast, studying topics ranging from Solid State physics, Microelectronics to programming.
- My main interest is in Electronics for Computer Architures & CPU/GPU Architectures.
- I also wrote some courses on Electrical Engineering topics (ie Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Semiconductor Physics and Computer Architecture).
- Please do reach out via email if you need anything from me!

- My current research topics are:
   * **CPU/FPGA**.
   * HW/SW co-design.
   * SoCs and NoCs.
   * VLSI.
   * **Multicore & SIMD Execution**.
   * **GPU Architecture**.
